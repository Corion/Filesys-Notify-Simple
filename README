NAME
    Filesys::Notify::Simple - Simple and dumb file system watcher

SYNOPSIS
      use Filesys::Notify::Simple;

      my $watcher = Filesys::Notify::Simple->new([ "." ]);
      $watcher->wait(sub {
          for my $event (@_) {
              $event->{dir}; # directory you were watching
              $event->{path} # full path of the file updated. May be undef in some environments
          }
      });

DESCRIPTION
    Filesys::Notify::Simple is a simple but unified interface to get
    notifications of changes to a given filesystem path. It utilizes
    inotify2 on Linux and fsevents on OS X if they're installed, with a
    fallback to the full directory scan if they're not available.

    There are some limitations in this module. If you don't like it, use
    File::ChangeNotify.

    *   There is no file name based filter. Do it in your own code.

    *   The full path is not always available, which is due to the
        limitation of Apple's fsevents API.

    *   You can not get types of events (created, updated, deleted).

    *   Curently it only has a blocking call API.

    In return, this module doesn't depend on any non-core modules. Platform
    specific optimizations with Linux::Inotify2 and Mac::FSEvents are truely
    optional.
